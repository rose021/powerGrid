HOW TO PLAY:
To start, run the PowerGridRunner class.

In Power Grid, each player is a power company competing to power more cities than the other players. 
The map is of the whole U.S., but only three of the colored areas get used based on the colors of the players playing in the game.

Each round has 5 phases:

Determining player order
Auction power plants
Buying resources
Building
Bureaucracy

A player powers cities by buying power plant cards, which power cities, putting power plants on cities, and buting resources to power each power plant. 
The winner is the player who has the most power plants at the end of the round where at least one player has at least 17 power plants powered.

Phase 1— Determining Turn Order

This is done automatically by the program

Phase 2— Auction Power Plants 

The first player begins and may choose to pass rather than bid on a chosen plant, in which case they forfeit the chance to bid on any power plants on a given round.
To choose a card to bid on simply tap the card that you want in the market. 
To pass, press the next turn button. 
In Steps one and two of the game only the top 4 cards in the game can be chosen but in step 3 any card can be chosen. 
An initial bid must be equal to or higher than the value of an available power plant. 
After the initial bid, players take turns bidding in clockwise order until every player has passed on a current bid. 
To bid, press the bid button and to drop out of the bidding, press pass. 
The player with the highest priority turn order (which may still be the first player) then has the option to bid on an available plant. 
Phase 2 ends when every player has either purchased a plant or passed on their opportunity to bid on a plant. 
Most power plants require one or a combination of resources: coal, oil, garbage (see waste to energy), and uranium, in order to supply electricity. 
Wind turbines and hydraulic plants do not require resources.

Phase 3— Buying Resources

In reverse turn order, players can buy resources for their plants. 
Players may only purchases resources they can use, and each plant may only hold twice the number of resources it needs to run. 
Thus a plant that uses two oil may hold up to four oil. 
As resources are purchased, they become more expensive, thus the person who is last in turn order can buy resources at the cheapest prices for that round. 
To buy a resource, click the card you want to put the resource on then click the type of resource you want. 
Once you're done, click the next turn button

Phase 4— Building 

In reverse turn order, players may build into cities. 
In the first round, a player may choose to build into any city that is not already occupied. 
A player may continue to expand by paying the cost to build into the desired city slot plus the value of all connections to that city from an already occupied city.
Simply click a city during phase 4 to build in that city. 
When you are done building, click the next turn button. 
No player may build into more than one slot in a city. 
Slot one costs 10 'Elektro' and is the only slot available during Step 1. 
During Step 2, the second slot is available at a cost of 15 Elektros, and in Step 3, the final slot is available at a cost of 20 Elektro.

Phase 5— Bureaucracy

During this phase, players expend resources to power their cities and earn more income (Elektro) based on the number of cities they power. 
Resources available to be purchased are replenished at a rate based on the number of players in the game as well as the current Step. 
Finally, the highest value power plant is placed at the bottom of the draw deck (this changes in Step 3). 
This is done automatically, but players have to choose how many of their cards they want to power in order to power their cities. 
For example, let's say that Ian has a power plant in 2 cities but his cards allow him to power 3. 
He could choose to only power certain cards or none at all so he does not waste resources.


The game is further divided into 3 "steps". 
In Step One, 8 power plants are visible to players arranged into two rows of four based on their numerical value ranking from lowest to highest. 
The first row of the lowest numbered plants is available to be bid on by players. 
In step one, only the first slot of a city may be built into.

Step Two is triggered when any player builds 7 cities. 
In Step Two, the lowest level plant from the plants in the market is removed from the game (this is only performed once, and in subsequent rounds when no power plant is bought at auction). 
In addition, the second city slot becomes available for players to build into. 
Finally, the resource replenishment rate is changed.

Step Three is triggered when the Step Three card comes up in the power plant deck. 
The Step Three card is initially placed at the bottom of the power plant deck. 
In Step 3, again, the lowest level plant from the plants in the market is removed from the game, and a new plant is not drawn to replace it. 
The available power plant pool now consists of 6 power plants that are all available to be bid on. 
The remaining power plant deck is shuffled to make a new draw deck.
